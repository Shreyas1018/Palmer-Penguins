# Palmer-Penguins

This dataset contains measurements of penguins in the Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica. The data were collected by Dr. Kristen Gorman and the Palmer Station, Antarctica LTER. The dataset includes information on the species, island, bill length, bill depth, flipper length, body mass, sex, and year for 344 penguins.

## Data Columns

- species: The species of penguin (Adelie, Chinstrap, or Gentoo) <br />
- island: The island where the penguin was measured (Dream, Biscoe, or Torgersen) <br />
- bill_length_mm: The length of the penguin's bill in millimeters <br />
- bill_depth_mm: The depth of the penguin's bill in millimeters <br />
- flipper_length_mm: The length of the penguin's flipper in millimeters <br />
- body_mass_g: The body mass of the penguin in grams <br />
- sex: The sex of the penguin (male or female) <br />
- year: The year in which the penguin was measured <br />

## Meet the penguins
The palmerpenguins data contains size measurements for three penguin species observed on three islands in the Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica.

These data were collected from 2007 - 2009 by Dr. Kristen Gorman with the Palmer Station Long Term Ecological Research Program, part of the US Long Term Ecological Research Network. The data were imported directly from the Environmental Data Initiative (EDI) Data Portal, and are available for use by CC0 license (“No Rights Reserved”) in accordance with the Palmer Station Data Policy.'

## Use of Dataset

This dataset can be used to study a variety of topics, such as the relationship between body size and bill size, the differences between the three species of penguins, and the changes in penguin populations over time. <br />
For this project, we'll  be limiting the scope to classify penguins species by applying various machine learning models
